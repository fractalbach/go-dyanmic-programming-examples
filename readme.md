- Breaking a problem into small similar problems, and saving the
solutions as you go.

- Dynamic Programming is typically applied to optimizations problems.



Solving a dynamic programming problems looks for ...

1. optimal substructure
2. Overlapping subproblems


Stuff

- matrix chain multiplication problem
- matrix chain order
