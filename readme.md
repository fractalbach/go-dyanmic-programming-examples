# Examples of Dynamic Programming in Go

- `/fibo` has a simple example of using memoization to find fibonnaci
  numbers
- `/staircase` is a solution to the number of ways you can climb a
  staircase when you can jump either 1, 2, or 3 steps at once.
- `/cuts` is based on the rod-cutting problem in _Introduction to
  Algorithms (3rd Edition)_
- `/powerset` calculates the powerset: all possible subsets of a set.

## Notes about Dynamic Programming in General

- Breaking a problem into small similar problems, and saving the
solutions as you go.

- Dynamic Programming is typically applied to optimizations problems.



Solving a dynamic programming problems looks for ...

1. optimal substructure
2. Overlapping subproblems
